PROJECT TITLE: Camera package
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Enable big worlds with a small part being displayed on the screen. Allows to automaticly follow an actor or be fixed to a certain location.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Copy this folder into your scenario folder. If you want to use it in a class simply import "camera.*" like you import greenfoot, too.
AUTHORS: RcCookie
USER INSTRUCTIONS: To get to know the methods I highly recomend that you go through the documentation at least of the camera class by simply opening Camera.java.
Read all the comments before the public methods and you should be good to go. The Ghost class is nessecary for the camera to be able to display stuff but has not got to be
known for the user.
IMPORTANT: Using camera works fine for collision detection between actors and key inputs, BUT not with mouse input. This might change at some point but for now you cannot
interact with the displayed stuff via right click or mouseInfo.
