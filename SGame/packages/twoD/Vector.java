 * The Vector class is used to store an arrow using containing an x and

 * Unlikethe official Vector, this one is not a type of list and cannot
 * contain a variable number of dimensions. Also, it can only store two
 * doubles and no other types of objects. Therefore, it contains a number
 * of helpful methods to interact with it in a mathmatical way which is
 * not supported by the official Vector class.
